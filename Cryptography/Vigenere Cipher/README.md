[Link to the challenge](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/305)

Let's decode this using Vigenere Cipher.

## Step 1
We are given 2 strings: `gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}` and `blorpy`.

The 1st string is obviously the flag encoded. So we can guess the second string is the key.

Using CyberChef, I decoded the flag.

## Solution
The flag is `flag{CiphersAreAwesome}`
