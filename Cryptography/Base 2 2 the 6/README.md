# Base 2 2 the 6
[Link to the challenge](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/192)

We need to decode a string.

## Step 1
We are given the following string: `Q1RGe0ZsYWdneVdhZ2d5UmFnZ3l9`.

I have to be sincere, this one got me thinking even tho it's really simple.

See, the title says Base 2 2 the 6. I've understood it this way: Base 2 to Base 6.

But you have to think it this way: Base 2^6 (Base 2 to the 6) which is Base 64.

I know, it's really silly from me but hey, just starting CTF :)

## Step 2
Knowing that I used Cyberchef and decode it from Base64, and got the flag.

## Solution
The flag is `CTF{FlaggyWaggyRaggy}`
