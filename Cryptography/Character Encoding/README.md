We need to decode a string of numbers.

## Step 1
We are given the string `41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D`.

Those numbers are hexadecimal.

I tried to decode it using ASCII (on CyberChef) and got the following output:
`ABCTF{45C11_15_U53FUL}`

## Solution
The flag is `ABCTF{45C11_15_U53FUL}`
