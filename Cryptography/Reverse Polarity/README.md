Just a bunch of bits to decode.

## Step 1
We are given the following string `01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101`.

From this, we can use CyberChef and decode it from binary which gives us the flag.

## Solution
The flag is `CTF{Bit_Flippin}`
