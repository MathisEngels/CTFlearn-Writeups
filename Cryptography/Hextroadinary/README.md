This one can be tricky for new comers (like myself).

## Step 1
We are given two hexadecimal values: `0xc4115` and `0x4cf8`.

In the title, they talk about `ROXy`. But they give us a hint by saying we need to use `XOR`.

## Step 2
I went to http://xor.pw/ and xor the 2 hex. We get the value: `0xc0ded`.

## Solution 
The flag is `0xc0ded`
