We need to find how websites used to look in the past.

## Step 1
We are told to look nasa.gov website on December 31, 1996. 

I knew I could do that. It's called `web archive`.
I googled `web archive` and clicked on the [first one]("https://web.archive.org/").

I looked for `nasa.gov` and found one snapshot from December 31, 1996.

The flag is over there.

## Solution
The flag is `CTFlearn{today@nasa.gov}`
