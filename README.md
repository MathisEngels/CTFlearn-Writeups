# CTFlearn Writeups
Writeups of all the [CTFlearn]("https://ctflearn.com/") challenges I solved.

CTFlearn is the first CTF website I try seriously. I wanted to document my process of thinking and how I achieved the challenges.

The main goal of this repo is to help others, and myself, to understand and learn a good workflow.

If you have any questions, feel free to add an issue.

## Attention
Try to do it yourself without looking at the solution, it's the best way to learn. I know, it can't be tough sometimes, but it worth the time. 

## Challenges by categories
- ### [Binary](./Binary/README.md)
- ### [Cryptography](./Cryptography/README.md)
- ### [Forensics](./Forensics/README.md)
- ### [Miscellaneous](./Miscellaneous/README.md)
- ### [Programming](./Programming/README.md)
- ### [Reverse Engineering](./Reverse%20Engineering/README.md)
- ### [Web](./Web/README.md)

## Why I am doing this ?
At the time I write this, I'm still studying for my master's degree in Cybersecurity. I want to have a career in this field, more particularly becoming a pentester.

From a lot of videos I watched about pentester and the ways to go, CTFs have always been said and promoted as a good way to train.

I already had tried some other CTF websites like rootme, hackthebox, etc... But I was never fully committed. CTFlearn had something special. I guess the "learn" convinced me that it won't be impossible for me.

CTFlearn is a good place for beginners. So far I didn't encounter any problem and if I was stuck, the comment section could always help me.

I already learned a lot and want to learn even more. Climb my way to the top of the leaderboard.

CTFlearn is the first one of many more.
